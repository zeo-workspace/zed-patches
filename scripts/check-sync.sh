#   3. patches <-> source   every patch still applies to the packaged tree
#   4. patches, clean       no patch carries a *.orig or *.rej file
#   5. version <-> changelog the packaged Zeo version has its CHANGELOG.md
#                            section (check-changelog.sh)
#
# 1 is the one no other script checks: sync-overlay.sh copies what the series
# names and reports what the overlay has spare, but neither side reads the
# ebuild, so a patch the ebuild stopped applying stays in both and looks fine.
#
# With no <PF>, the version is taken from the overlay when it holds exactly one
# series-carrying ebuild — the common case, and unambiguous when it holds.
#
# Exit: 0 everything agrees · 1 a relation drifted · 2 environment problem.
