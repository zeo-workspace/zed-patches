# Build app-editors/zeo for x86-64-v3 and package it as the zeo-bin distfile.
#
#     release-zeo-bin.sh <PF> [--fresh]
#
# One command for the whole release build, unprivileged:
#
#   1. `ebuild <zeo ebuild> compile install` under release/configroot, which
#      replaces /etc/portage for this build -- the host's make.conf appends
#      target-cpu=znver5 to any RUSTFLAGS, so flags on the command line are not
#      enough. PORTAGE_INST_UID/GID are the caller's, because install(1) cannot
#      chown to root without root; the tarball resets ownership to 0:0 anyway.
#   2. make-bin-release.sh, which refuses a non-v3 or AVX-512 binary and writes
#      ${DISTDIR}/zeo-bin-<PVR>-amd64.tar.xz with PROVENANCE.txt.
#
# A build directory left by an earlier run of the same PF is reused, so a failed
# install does not cost the 20-minute compile again; --fresh discards it.
#
# A version with no CHANGELOG.md section is refused before the build starts
# (check-changelog.sh): the release body is that section (changelog-notes.sh).
#
# It never uploads and never touches the zeo-bin Manifest: the Manifest must
# describe the bytes the Zeo GitHub release serves, so it is regenerated only
# after the upload, which a human authorizes each time. The steps are printed at the end.
#
# Environment: ZP_RELEASE_TMPDIR (default ~/.cache/zeo-release) and the ZP_*
# overrides lib.sh honours, ZP_OVERLAY among them.
#
# Exit: 0 written · 1 the build or the binary is not releasable · 2 environment.
