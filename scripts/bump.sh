#
# The four steps a version bump has always taken, in order, each gating the next:
#
#   1. refresh      regenerate every patch against the new packaged source
#   2. verify       confirm the regenerated series applies, from a clean baseline
#      rebrand      ...and brings in nothing new that still says "Zed"
#                   (check-rebrand.sh; a new entry is a decision, so it stops here)
#   3. sync         copy it into the overlay's files/
#   4. check-sync   confirm all three relations agree afterwards
#
# Ahead of all four runs the advisory step: the chain's lockfiles read against
# the OSV database. Its place is first on purpose. Every exit this script can
# take from step 1 onwards -- the one success and all five failures -- lies
# below it, so it is the part of the run that reports whatever else happens,
# including on the bump that stopped early. That is precisely the run where a
# known vulnerability in what is about to ship matters most. It gates nothing,
# nothing gates it, and it NEVER moves the exit code.
#
# Without --apply, step 3 is a dry run: the run reports what would be copied and
# writes nothing to the overlay. Step 1 does write, but only inside this
# repository, where git can undo it.
#
# What this deliberately does NOT do is edit the ebuild. Which patches apply, and
# under which USE flag, is the one part of a bump that encodes intent no script
# can infer -- so when the refreshed series no longer matches the ebuild's
# PATCHES+=() list, this stops and says so rather than guessing. That is the
# handoff, not a failure.
#
# Versions are discovered when not given: --to from the overlay's single zed
# ebuild, --from as the newest series already in patches/ that is not --to.
#
# Exit: 0 bumped · 1 a step failed or a decision is waiting · 2 environment problem.
# The advisory step contributes to none of the three.
